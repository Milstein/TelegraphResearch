        <p>The following corrections to this report have been made after a follow-up email from Hired CEO Matt Mickiewicz:</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Candidates are assigned a <em>Talent Advocate.</em> The original article stated that they were assigned an <em>Account Manager.</em></li>
            <li> The report now notes that companies are assigned an Account Manager</li>
            <li>The <a href="#growth" class="to-growth">Financial Analysis</a> section originally estimated that the number of candidates per auction have been constant from launch at approximately 40 to 50 per week. According to Matt, Hired currently curates 80-100 candidates per week. No changes to the model or analysis have been made, but an annotation has been added.</li>
