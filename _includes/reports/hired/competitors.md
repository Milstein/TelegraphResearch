###[Whitetruffle](https://www.whitetruffle.com/)

Founded in August of 2011, Whitetruffle is similar to Hired but adds some automation features. Although both services require candidates to fill out an online profile, Whitetruffle doesn’t have an approval process and also adds a proprietary algorithm to match candidates with employers. Employers may browse through candidates anonymously and like Hired, express their interest in candidates. Additionally, if the Whitetruffle algorithm finds an applicant to be a good match for a listed opening, both the employer and the candidate are notified. If both parties show interest, contact information will be automatically exchanged to enable direct conversation. Whitetruffle claims to have over 2,000 employers and more than 30,000 candidates in their database. Unlike Hired, Whitetruffle does not use a time-sensitive auction. Thus, all candidates remain in the system and a new employer may find a compatible match in an older candidate. It seems that poor candidates will always remain in the system, requiring more manual sifting, however the algorithm may overcome this tediousness. Hired’s approach to selective candidate filtering, weekly auctions, and always with new candidates, provides a system that may be more reliable and sustainable. Whitetruffle claims they can save about 30-40% of the time needed to source talent, but that could change with a bloated, crowded marketplace. According to Pando Daily, [companies subscribe for a monthly subscription](http://pando.com/2013/09/19/whitetruffle-another-platform-claiming-to-fix-the-broken-recruiting-system/) that starts at nearly $8,000 per year; it is unclear what type of hiring fee is demanded.

###[ZLemma](http://zlemma.com/home/)

ZLemma is a Series A-funded startup that was founded in late 2012. ZLemma differs from Hired in that it is not a direct recruiting agency and offers no human interaction. ZLemma provides a service that uses extensive mathematical algorithms and modeling to give science, technology, engineering, and mathematics professionals a score to indicate how suited they are for a given opening. The service is free for potential candidates, while employers are charged to have candidates scored against their openings. It is unclear if ZLemma receives additional compensation for successful placement. While Hired specifically focuses on recruiting for technology companies, ZLemma aims to cater to any industry with demands for STEM talent.

###[Bright](http://www.bright.com/)

Like ZLemma, Bright also applies data science techniques to help candidates discover which position is most suitable for their skills. The company was founded in early 2011 and today has over 50 employees. Bright is far more mature than ZLemma and is able to assist professionals in any field; not just limited to STEM areas. The service is free to all job seekers, but companies must pay for a [subscription service](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bright-com) that starts at $219 per month for a single posting plan. In their three year history, Bright [received $20 million in funding](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bright-com) in Series A and B rounds, and was acquired by LinkedIn in February 2014.

###[CyberCoders](http://www.cybercoders.com/)

Founded in 1999 and today with around 250 employees, CyberCoders is a company that acts as glorified jobs board with dedicated recruiters. Companies may reach out to CyberCoders and have a job opening be posted, and anyone can browse through the site to see current listings and apply. A CyberCoder recruiter will screen all applicants and then make arrangements for an interview to begin if he/she is deemed qualified. CyberCoder recruiters also work like ordinary recruiters and will headhunt for the right talent for an open position. The company has focused in the tech industry, but there are also many listings for non-technical positions such as marketing.

###[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)

LinkedIn remains the elephant in the room for recruiting startups. The publicly-traded company has a market capitalization of over $20 billion and provides the world’s largest database of job seekers. For access to this information, professional recruiters pay a per-recruiter annual fee about $8,000. 

LinkedIn is used heavily for technical recruiting, but any startup attempting to enter the recruiting industry should seek to address an inefficiency in the LinkedIn business model. For technical recruiting specifically, job leads through LinkedIn tend to be generic and impersonal. Salary information is not disclosed. Thus, startups seek to provide better matches between candidates and companies by using proprietary algorithms or personal services that the LinkedIn system does not provide. 

###Traditional Recruiting Agency

Traditional recruiting agencies, such as [Riviera Partners](http://rivierapartners.com/), work to connect job candidates to companies. Due to dynamic nature of the field, this presents difficulties whereby these agencies attempt to keep personal information for candidates away from hiring companies for as long a possible. This prevents candidates and companies from circumnavigating the agency. For both candidates and companies, this leads to frustrating generic conversations where only vague information may be presented.
