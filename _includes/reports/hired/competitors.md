##Whitetruffle

Founded in August 2011, [Whitetruffle](https://www.whitetruffle.com/) provides a similar as Hired but adds some automation features. Although both services require candidates to fill out an online profile, Whitetruffle does not have an approval process. It uses a proprietary algorithm to match candidates with employers. Employers may browse through candidates anonymously and, like Hired, express their interest in candidates in their marketplace. Additionally, if the Whitetruffle algorithm finds an applicant to be a good match for a listed opening, both the employer and the candidate are notified. If both parties show interest, contact information is automatically exchanged to enable direct conversation. Whitetruffle claims to have over 2,000 employers and more than 30,000 candidates in their database. Unlike Hired, Whitetruffle does not use a timed auction. Thus, all candidates remain in the system and a new employer may find a compatible match in an older candidate. It seems that poor candidates will always remain in the system, requiring more manual sifting, however the algorithm may overcome this tediousness. Hired’s approach to selective candidate filtering, weekly auctions, and candidate freshness provides a system that may be more reliable and sustainable. Whitetruffle claims they can save about 30-40% of the time needed to source talent, but that efficiency could decrease with a crowded marketplace should the company scale. According to Pando Daily, [companies subscribe for a monthly subscription](http://pando.com/2013/09/19/whitetruffle-another-platform-claiming-to-fix-the-broken-recruiting-system/) that starts at nearly $8,000 per year; it is unclear what type of hiring fee is demanded.

##ZLemma

[ZLemma](http://zlemma.com/home/) is a Series A-funded startup that was founded in late 2012. ZLemma differs from Hired in that it is not a direct recruiting agency and offers no manual curation. ZLemma provides a service that uses extensive mathematical algorithms and modeling to give science, technology, engineering, and mathematics professionals a score to indicate how suited they are for a given opening. The service is free for potential candidates, while employers are charged to have candidates scored against their openings. It is unclear if ZLemma receives additional compensation for successful placement. While Hired specifically focuses on recruiting for technology companies, ZLemma aims to cater to any industry with demands for STEM talent.

##Bright

Like ZLemma, [Bright](http://www.bright.com/) also applies data science techniques to help candidates discover which position is most suitable for their skills. The company was founded in early 2011 and today has over 50 employees. The Bright marketplace is more mature than that of ZLemma and is able to assist professionals in any field. The service is free to all job seekers, but companies must pay for a [subscription service](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bright-com) that starts at $219 per month for a single posting plan. In their three year history, Bright [received $20 million in funding](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/bright-com) in Series A and B rounds, and was acquired by LinkedIn in February 2014.

##CyberCoders

Founded in 1999 and today with around 250 employees, [CyberCoders](http://www.cybercoders.com/) is a company that acts as digital jobs board with staff recruiters. Companies have a job opening posted, and anyone can browse through the site to see current listings and apply. A CyberCoder recruiter screens all applicants and then makes arrangements for an interview to begin if the fit is appropriate. CyberCoder recruiters also work like ordinary recruiters and will manually screen its database for job seekers that fit an open position. The company has focused on the technology industry, but there are also many listings for non-technical positions such as marketing.

##LinkedIn

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) remains the elephant in the room for recruiting startups. The publicly traded company has a market capitalization of over $20 billion and provides the world’s largest database of job seekers. For access to this information, professional recruiters pay a per-recruiter annual fee about $8,000. 

LinkedIn is used heavily for technical recruiting, but any startup attempting to enter the recruiting industry should seek to address the inefficiencies in the LinkedIn business model. For technical recruiting specifically, job leads through LinkedIn tend to be generic and impersonal. Not all candidates are actively seeking a new position. Salary information is not often disclosed. Thus, startups seek to provide better matches between candidates and companies by using proprietary algorithms or personal services that the LinkedIn system does not provide. 

##Traditional Recruiting Agency

Traditional recruiting agencies, such as [Riviera Partners](http://rivierapartners.com/), work to connect job candidates to companies. Due to dynamic nature of the field, maintaining relationships with both job seekers and companies is difficult.  Agencies attempt to keep personal information of candidates away from hiring companies for as long a possible to prevent candidates and companies from circumnavigating the agency. For both candidates and companies, this leads to frustrating generic conversations where only vague information may be presented.
