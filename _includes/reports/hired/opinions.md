When I started looking for an engineering job in San Francisco as I graduated from college, my mantra became “startups suck at hiring.” From badly-run interviews to out-of-date job descriptions to recruiters that didn’t answer emails, the hiring process at most companies did not reflect the innovation and success of current employees. The Hired marketplace brings a refreshing approach to a broken industry, but success will be determined by expanding this model to new industries.

While researching Hired, I found insight for the recruiting industry through the book “Smart People Build Things” by Venture for America founder Andrew Yang. The book discusses the barriers for entry to the startup world, and how the consulting industry has optimized its recruiting funnel. I saw many successful characteristics of consultant recruiting in Hired. Candidates meet somebody from the company that serves as an advocate. Applying for the role resembles a familiar “common application” for colleges. The process feels familiar, and it creates two-way feedback between companies and applicants early in the process. Per their success thus far, Hired fixes technical recruiting. 

To justify a Series A round, Hired needs to broaden its scope without sacrificing efficacy. The current technical recruiting process functions in its broken state because it is so lucrative. The transparent recruiting process of Hired has been successful for technical roles where the applicants tend to be more data-driven and rational. The true marker for the success of Hired is whether they may maintain a high candidate offer acceptance rate in other industries where emotions, name recognition, and a bond with the company will become more important to candidates as they accept offers. If the conversion rate from candidate to placed employee can be maintained in other industries, then Hired could be a $500 million worldwide recruiting company in 5 years.

Hired fixed a broken industry, but it has not yet proven itself to be a “career marketplace for workers in the world.” In the technology industry, startups suck at recruiting. However, other industries thrive on efficient, honed strategies to obtain the best candidates. To scale from a boutique business to a recruiting  cornerstone, Hired will have to prove that its transparent model can unseat entrenched businesses and recruiting mindsets.

I first came across Hired through LinkedIn advertising and checked out their service. Being a recent grad and currently looking for engineering positions, I applied and was quickly accepted for the next upcoming auction. Hired recruiters assisted me in perfecting my profile and made sure I understood exactly how the process worked. The auction began on a Monday and within the first day I had 5 preliminary offers. A few of the companies looked interesting to me and I accepted them, declining the other two. Hired provides an email-integrated messaging service that makes it a little easier to communicate with the companies and schedule calls. For the rest of the week I fielded calls, Google Hangouts, and remote coding interviews. Of the three companies, I realized I was not interested in one, was mildly intrigued by another, and started to get serious with a third. After reaching out to me on Monday, I had a verbal commitment to an offer of employment on Friday. Unfortunately, the other co-founder at that company decided they needed someone with more experience though. Although I ultimately did not receive an offer through Hired, I can say it was a far better experience than I have had anywhere else. The process moves fast, the Hired recruiters are very supportive, and companies are great with communication. This is far better than the alternatives from a candidate point of view.

During my auction, I noticed that Hired deliberately uses the word “offer” with a double-meaning. Their home page features real-time stats for the percentage of candidates who received an offer, but that only indicates the desire for an interview, which isn’t very useful. The percentage of candidates accepting offers - the only source of revenue for Hired - has to be far lower than their promotional material . In our interview, Matt indicated that the New York office is already profitable, but he declined to disclose any information regarding true offers of employment or profitability for the rest of Hired. In October 2013, investor Semil Shah revealed that Hired is in fact profitable.

The Telegraph Research financial model makes very few estimates and our goal was to piece together all the bits of information that we found across the Internet. According to our model, Hired has the ability of making around $2.7mm in profits for 2014 after being negative in 2012 and 2013. I think Hired has an opportunity to continue thriving in this space as they have a system that is becoming very lucrative with both talent and employers seeming to like the process more than existing alternatives. The company can certainly continue to grow organically, but I think a Series A round might be in the plans for late 2014. News articles and our interview make me think Hired will be interested in expanding beyond the tech industry and into other sectors. A broader spectrum of STEM positions will probably be the first step, but there are a lot of options after that. Trying to add cities and broaden the product will take more capital than what remains on their Seed round and incoming profits.
