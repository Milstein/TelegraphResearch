| :-------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Market Overview | Hiring for technology companies is a competitive but lucrative market. The main competition is LinkedIn, a $20 billion company that serves as the largest jobseeker database in the world. |
| Company History | Hired was founded in May 2012 as *Developer Auction*, but rebranded as Hired in September 2013 as they launched their first auction. Clients range from startups to Fortune 500 companies. |
| Investment Timeline | The three cofounders provided the initial funding for Hired. In January 2013, they raised a $2.7 million venture round with participation. |
| Management Team | Hired was co-founded by three successful entrepreneurs: Matt Mickiewicz, founder of 99 Designs and Flippa, Douglas Feirstein, founder of LiveOps, and Allan Grant, founder of Curebit.
| Growth Outlook and Potential Returns | Investors have stated that Hired was profitable as of October 2013. We built a model that estimates that about 40% of candidates that receive an offer through Hired accept. |
| Competitive Landscape | LinkedIn dominates the recruiting market, and most startups aim to compete with LinkedIn using proprietary algorithmic approaches. |
| Comparable Exits | After the LinkedIn IPO in May 2011, most comparable exits have consisted of acquisitinos by LinkedIn. |
| Technology | The Hired marketplace is built using Ruby on Rails. Security remains a concern after an employee email account was hijacked and sent phishing emails to clients. |
| Opinions | Hired has a high offer rate, but the key metric is percentage of offers that are accepted.|
