## How it Works

A job seeker applies to Hired using their LinkedIn profile, which functions as a resume. 

From these applications, Hired approves a group of candidates to go to an auction. As of writing, these auctions each typically consist of 40-50 candidates, and they are conducted every week.

Upon being accepted to an auction, a candidate is assigned a Talent Advocates who coaches the candidate through the process and assists them with improving their profile. The candidate’s profile serves as a resume that describes education background, skills, experiences, and significant projects. Candidates may also solicit written professional recommendations, which appear on the profile.

Companies seeking access to the Hired marketplace must apply in a similar manner. To qualify, they must be venture-funded or publicly traded. Upon being accepted to the marketplace, companies gain access to the profiles of candidates in the current auction. The system prevents companies from being able to see any of their current or past employees. Companies are also assigned an Account Manager.

There is no cost for job applicants or companies to join the marketplace.

When each auction begins, the new candidates are listed and any registered employer may visit the site and browse through each candidate profile. If anything on a candidate profile is unclear, the company may anonymously ask a question, which is then added to the profile with the candidate response.

Companies that are interested in hiring a candidate must submit a bid through Hired. According to current marketing materials, 85% of the candidates receive a preliminary offer, which provides information on the company, the role, the salary, and equity terms upfront. The [average salary](http://www.forbes.com/sites/o/2013/10/30/hired-com-has-built-what-every-tech-company-wants-a-pipeline-of-top-technical-talent/) is currently $128,000. These offers are not binding, but according to the CEO of Hired, offered terms are reflective of final negotiated salaries 90% of the time.

For every job offer, candidates are presented with three buttons: “I’m interested,” “Request Revision,” and “Decline.” Candidates who express interest in a role proceed with interviews arranged by the company. Final salary negotiations take place after successful interviews.

A candidate who accepts a job offer through the Hired.com system is given a $2,000 bonus directly from Hired. The hiring company then pays a fee to Hired equivalent to 1% of the negotiated final salary every month for the following 24 months. Payments by the company to Hired only continue as long as the employee remains at the company. 

To prevent companies from circumventing the bid process, Hired offers a bounty of $200 Amazon credit to candidates for reporting companies that attempt to hire the candidate without first providing an offer though the website. 


## History

Hired was founded in May 2012 as a Delaware Corporation under the name DeveloperAuction, but later [rebranded as Hired](http://techcrunch.com/2013/09/17/developer-auction-is-hired-com/) in September 2013. The company’s [first auction](http://techcrunch.com/2012/09/06/quora-airbnb-others-made-30m-in-job-offers-to-engineers-in-first-2-weeks-of-developerauction/) began on August 31st, 2012 and saw over $30M in preliminary offers. Since then, nearly $1.2B in preliminary offers have been made by over 700 different employers, which are usually startups in the Seed or Series A stages. During our interview, Hired CEO Matt Mickiewicz listed additional large companies as clients, including [Square](http://squareup.com), [Facebook](http://facebook.com), [Staples](http://staples.com), [American Express](http://americanexpress.com), and [Capital One](http://capitalone.com). In January 2013, the company raised a [venture funding round of $2.7M](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/14/developerauction/) from investors that include SoftTech VC, New Enterprise Associates (NEA), and Google Ventures. After closing this round, Jake Medwell joined as an official advisor. All three founders, Allan Grant, Matt Mickiewicz, and Doug Feirstein, still remain with the company, while Trent Krupp joined as Director and Mehul Patel as COO. According to [Crunchbase](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/hired), Sujay Tyle briefly held the COO position for a six month period before Mehul.
