After checking out a free trial, I have come to the conclusion that Mattermark is building a product that could become very useful, but they need to make some adjustments in order to achieve that. Public companies are required to publish their financial performance, but private companies are not obligated to do so, making it difficult to gauge true performance. Currently there are no established tools to quantitatively measure private equity, and Mattermark is one of the early entrants in this newly developing market.

Of the competitors I found, I thought DataFox was the most promising, but compared to Mattermark it was not quite as good in a venture capital sense. Mattermark gives a larger offering of time series data, which is crucial for observing trends and more importantly, growth. Both Mattermark and DataFox attempt to assign an arbitrary score to indicate value and potential growth, but I found neither to be very useful or indicative of anything. Mattermark’s score is based off of their time series data, which is mostly collected from social media sources. Thus, a lot of their data is reactive and so is their score. Mattermark has had a very small engineering team, but now that they are growing, I’d like to see them try to provide more value out of their data. There could be a lot of predictive insights to be drawn from it, but right now their product hardly tries to do that.

To qualify for an additional venture round, Mattermark won’t get it by selling their product to venture capitalists. Pitched as a business intelligence tool, Mattermark would likely see more success and have access to a much larger attainable market. With their offered Salesforce integration, a salesperson can use Mattermark to asses the current trends of a company and better understand their position towards any purchases. The search and filtering tools would allow a salesperson to discover more potential customers and develop new leads. All of these insights are available without having to figure out how to make accurate predictions with such little data.

Mattermark has identified a great gap and are on the leading edge of a quickly growing market, but their product needs a redirection. I suggest they make a strong push towards a business intelligence tool for salespeople, and let the venture capitalists be a secondary effort. Providing true, predictive value for venture capital investments is going to be extremely difficult and require a very talented quantitative team, whereas a salesperson does not need any of that, and will find great benefit with their existing product. If they choose this path, Mattermark will need to add the same insights into all publicly traded companies, but that is even easier than what they have already done.

Based on my experiences in funds trading public and private equities, the private equity market lacks access to the granular information of public stocks. It takes a team of analysts to replicate the equivalent of a Yahoo Finance page for a private company. Mattermark seeks to address data disparity in private markets with an intriguing approach, but the analysis they provide is better suited for sales intelligence than financial forecasting. 

Mattermark has found a market ripe for change where customers are willing to pay. Data-driven, algorithmic purchasing in public markets has long been the norm. Private equity markets lack the transparency and ease of data access as public markets. However, private equity is thriving industry. Because of the threshold for becoming an accredited investor in the United States, institutional funds or wealthy individuals conduct most private investing. Ownership of these companies is highly illiquid and windows to invest are short and competitive as those raising funds have the ability to choose whom they wish to partner with. Thus decisions must be informed. Mattermark seeks to create informed screening and decisions in the private equity market. Providing a novel tool to quantify private equities will prove lucrative. 

Unfortunately, Mattermark provides no analysis of metrics that actually matter for companies. Beyond the results of a simple Crunchbase search, they only provide insight on social engagement trends. All data sources appear to be public to an extent. Thus, they fail to directly report or gauge any financial metrics. While tracking and comparing social trends provides limited insight, this approach alone does not provide meaningful analysis of core business performance. 

Another area that concerns me is the conclusions drawn by Mattermark. Their proprietary score provides no meaningful insight due to its scale. With company scores ranging from -2000 to +3000, the correlation appears mainly to be social success rather than business traction. In businesses that recently made announcements about acquisitions, investments, or exits the scores seemed inflated due to increased traffic - thus making the score reactive rather than predictive. Instagram has three times the “Mattermark Score” of WhatsApp, even though its acquisition was priced $18 billion dollars below that of WhatsApp. This is not the type of insight investors desire.

The utility I foresee for the Mattermark platform is as a sales intelligence tool. Their current Salesforce integration allows sales development efforts to be concentrated on specific company profiles and characteristics. During the sales process, social insight provided by Mattermark may provide insight about growth, trends, and users. The “Mattermark Score” would have utility as a reactive tool for identifying companies that just raised money and are ready to purchase. One-off errors or model inconsistencies would be tolerated because sales focuses on building a funnel that targets many companies and only expects a few to close. 

Overall, Mattermark has identified a ripe market but has failed to deliver a product with financial insight. Instead, I predict that Mattermark will become a valuable tool for identifying and investigating companies in sales organizations.
