Based on my experiences in funds trading public and private equities, the private equity market lacks access to the granular information of public stocks. It takes a team of analysts to replicate the equivalent of a Yahoo Finance page for a private company. Mattermark seeks to address data disparity in private markets with an intriguing approach, but the analysis they provide is better suited for sales intelligence than financial forecasting. 

Mattermark has found a market ripe for change where customers are willing to pay. Data-driven, algorithmic purchasing in public markets has long been the norm. Private equity markets lack the transparency and ease of data access as public markets. However, private equity is thriving industry. Because of the threshold for becoming an accredited investor in the United States, institutional funds or wealthy individuals conduct most private investing. Ownership of these companies is highly illiquid and windows to invest are short and competitive as those raising funds have the ability to choose whom they wish to partner with. Thus decisions must be informed. Mattermark seeks to create informed screening and decisions in the private equity market. Providing a novel tool to quantify private equities will prove lucrative. 

Unfortunately, Mattermark provides no analysis of metrics that actually matter for companies. Beyond the results of a simple Crunchbase search, they only provide insight on social engagement trends. All data sources appear to be public to an extent. Thus, they fail to directly report or gauge any financial metrics. While tracking and comparing social trends provides limited insight, this approach alone does not provide meaningful analysis of core business performance. 

Another area that concerns me is the conclusions drawn by Mattermark. Their proprietary score provides no meaningful insight due to its scale. With company scores ranging from -2000 to +3000, the correlation appears mainly to be social success rather than business traction. In businesses that recently made announcements about acquisitions, investments, or exits the scores seemed inflated due to increased traffic - thus making the score reactive rather than predictive. Instagram has three times the “Mattermark Score” of WhatsApp, even though its acquisition was priced $18 billion dollars below that of WhatsApp. This is not the type of insight investors desire.

The utility I foresee for the Mattermark platform is as a sales intelligence tool. Their current Salesforce integration allows sales development efforts to be concentrated on specific company profiles and characteristics. During the sales process, social insight provided by Mattermark may provide insight about growth, trends, and users. The “Mattermark Score” would have utility as a reactive tool for identifying companies that just raised money and are ready to purchase. One-off errors or model inconsistencies would be tolerated because sales focuses on building a funnel that targets many companies and only expects a few to close. 

Overall, Mattermark has identified a ripe market but has failed to deliver a product with financial insight. Instead, I predict that Mattermark will become a valuable tool for identifying and investigating companies in sales organizations.
