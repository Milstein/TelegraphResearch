After testing the platform, I have come to the conclusion that Mattermark is building a product that could become useful after some adjustments. Public companies are required to publish their financial performance, but private companies are not obligated to do so, thus making it difficult to gauge financial performance. Currently there are few tools to quantify private equity, and Mattermark is one of the early entrants in this developing market.

Of the competitors I found, I thought that DataFox was the most promising, but it lacks the utility of Mattermark for venture capitalists. Mattermark offers better time series data crucial for observing trends and growth. Both Mattermark and DataFox attempt to assign an arbitrary score that indicates value and potential growth, but I found neither score to be insightful. Mattermark’s score is based on their time series data, which is mostly collected from social media sources. Thus, the reactive nature of their data sources is reflected as a reactive score. Mattermark has had a very small engineering team, but now that they are growing I expect more meaningful analyis of their data. Currently their system provides better information than insights.

To garner further investment Mattermark must expand its market beyond venture capitalists. Pitching Mattermark as a business intelligence tool would provide access to a larger and more attainable market. With their current Salesforce integration, a salesperson can use Mattermark to assess the current trends of a company and better understand their inclination towards any purchases. The search and filtering tools allow a salesperson to discover more potential customers and develop new leads. All of these insights are available without having to figure out how to make accurate predictions with such little data.

Mattermark has created a powerful tool, but their product needs some redirection. I suggest that Mattermark pivots to a business intelligence tool for salespeople. Providing true, predictive value for venture capital investments is going to be difficult and require a talented quantitative team, whereas a salesperson requires a less advanced product not very different from the current one. If they choose this path, Mattermark should extend its insights to all publicly traded companies.

Based on my experiences in funds trading public and private equities, the private equity market lacks access to the granular information of public stocks. It takes a team of analysts to replicate the equivalent of a Yahoo Finance page for a private company. Mattermark seeks to address data disparity in private markets with an intriguing approach, but the analysis they provide is better suited for sales intelligence than for financial forecasting. 

Unfortunately, Mattermark provides no metrics that actually matter for companies. Beyond the results of a simple Crunchbase search, they only provide little more than insight on social engagement trends. Mattermark fails to directly report or gauge any financial metrics. While tracking and comparing social trends provides limited insight, this approach alone does not provide meaningful analysis of core business performance. 

Another area that concerns me is the conclusions presented by Mattermark in the form of their eponymous score. With company scores ranging seemingly unbounded from -2000 to +3000, the correlation appears mainly to be of social success instead than business traction. In businesses that recently made announcements about acquisitions, investments, or exits the scores seemed inflated due to increased traffic  and buzz - thus making the score reactive rather than predictive. Instagram has three times the “Mattermark Score” of WhatsApp, even though its acquisition was priced $18 billion dollars below that of WhatsApp. This is not the type of insight investors desire.

The utility I foresee for the Mattermark platform is as a sales intelligence tool. Their current Salesforce integration allows sales development efforts to be concentrated on specific company profiles and characteristics. During the sales process, social trends identified by Mattermark may provide insight about growth, trends, and users. The “Mattermark Score” would have utility as a reactive tool for identifying companies that just raised money and are ready to make new purchases. One-off errors or model inconsistencies would be tolerated because sales focuses on building a funnel that targets many companies and only expects a few to close. 

Overall, Mattermark has identified a ripe market but has failed to deliver a product with financial significance. Instead, I predict that Mattermark will become a valuable tool sales organizations to identify and investigate companies.
