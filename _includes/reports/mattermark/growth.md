## Financial Model 


Historical information about the performance of Mattermark is limited, and the short amount of time that the company has been selling its product suggests that internal metrics are likely unreliable for future projections. We constructed a model using basic assumptions about the business based on data we collected and general SaaS performance. The primary purpose of this model is determining when Mattermark will raise a Series A round. The model considers the history since Mattermarkâ€™s launch date, June 2013, through the end of 2014. The model then tries to estimate monthly costs and possible revenue based off on assumptions about the performance of their sales staff.

LinkedIn profiles yielded data about the employees of Mattermark, including their respective start dates. This model assumes that each employee will cost the company $150,000 a year, which includes salary, office space, equipment, and benefits.

The size of the sales staff over time was also gathered using LinkedIn. Using the known number of available salespeople per month, the model then assumes that after 2 months of onboarding, each salesperson is able to an average of 7 new deals per month. We estimate that the average deal size is on average $1,500 as a balance between individual and team plans. For the monthly net margin, the model adds new deals with existing monthly recurring revenue and subtracts an estimated monthly churn of 9%.

We assigned a two-month onboarding time before a salesperson was at regular capacity because it would take approximately one month to generate leads plus one month of a free trial period. The churn rate of 9% monthly is a high estimate, but we believe that the company will begin selling annual subscriptions to curb this metric.

## Future Funding 

We predict that Mattermark will raise a $1.5 million dollar Series A round at an $8 million valuation near June 2014. By the end of the year we expect that Mattermark will focus on a lower-priced plan that integrates with Salesforce for use as a sales intelligence platform. One of the financial major barriers to growth in the private equity market will be the cost of acquiring proprietary data.
