## Financial Model 


Historical information about the performance of Mattermark is limited, and the short amount of time that the company has been selling its product suggests that internal metrics are likely unreliable for future projections. We constructed a model using basic assumptions about the business based on data we collected and general SaaS performance. The primary purpose of this model is determining when Mattermark will raise a Series A round. The model considers the history since Mattermarkâ€™s launch date, June 2013, through the 2014 calendar year on a monthly basis. The model then tries to estimate monthly costs and possible revenue based off of assumptions about the performance of their sales staff.

LinkedIn yielded data about the employees of Mattermark, including their respective start dates. This model considers each employee will cost the company $150,000 a year including salary, office space, equipment, and benefits. Certain fixed costs were built into the employee cost, such as office space. 

The size of the sales staff over time was also gathered using LinkedIn. Using the known number of available salespeople per month, the model then assumes that after 2 months of onboarding, each salesperson is able to close around 7 new deals a month. We estimated that the average deal size is around $1,500 in monthly recurring revenue as a balance between individual and team plans. For the monthly net margin, the model adds new deals with existing monthly recurring revenue and subtracts an estimated churn of 9%.

We assigned a 2 month onboarding time before a salesperson was at regular capacity because it would take approximately one month to generate leads plus one month when the leads have a free trial prior to paying. The churn rate of 9% monthly is a relatively high estimate, but we believe that the company will begin selling annual subscriptions to curb this metric.

## Future Funding 

We predict that Mattermark will raise a $1.5 million dollar Series A round at an $8 million valuation near June 2014. By the end of the year we expect that Mattermark will focus on a lower-priced plan that integrates with Salesforce for use as a sales intelligence platform. One of the major barriers to growth will be the cost of acquiring proprietary data.
