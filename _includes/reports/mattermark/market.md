Mattermark is a business intelligence tool in the SaaS industry. The IPO of SalesForce.com set the standard for account of SaaS companies and pioneered the industry. 


## Size

The Software as a Service (SaaS) industry is valued at [over $15 billion](http://www.information-age.com/technology/cloud-and-virtualisation/2095578/saas-will-be-$145bn-market-this-year---gartner) per year. The main factor driving growth continues to grow as new products are developed that address inefficiencies in other markets. The subspace for business intelligence within private companies is considerably smaller but rapidly growing.



## Strengths

Mattermark provides insight into companies using quantifiable metrics. This data enables customers to make informed decisions. The filtering features of Mattermark also allow customers to identify companies that meet certain parameters and would be otherwise difficult to identify. The company brings familiar tools that exist to analyze publicly-traded companies and extends that coverage to private companies.

## Weaknesses

The metrics Mattermark provides do not directly measure any financial metrics about companies. The proprietary “Mattermark Score” has unknown reliability and utility. 

## Opportunities

Mattermark has the opportunity to provide intelligence data to sales professionals. This market is large, proven, and lucrative. Mattermark already provides a Salesforce integration, but focusing their product on the needs of salespeople could prove to be more valuable. 

## Threats

Mattermark has no proprietary data and its proprietary scoring algorithm is currently of little value. Thus, it is possible for many competitors to enter the space. Three main threats exist. The first threat is if an existing financial company that covers public markets expands into covering private markets. This company would have a much stronger reputation and could thus acquire customers more easily. The second threat that exists is that a competitor obtains better data than Mattermark. The third threat is that a competitor develops a better algorithm that correctly predicts private equity financial trends. 

## Key Factors

Mattermark participates in the market of quantifying private technology companies. The benefit here is not the direct financial analysis of particular companies, but the ability to filter through companies, find competitors, and use alternative data metrics to gain insight once similarities have been identified.

Mattermark is targeted towards private equity investors as a search and analysis tool, but it is also being marketed as a business intelligence tool for salespeople. This sales intelligence strategy may be the key to Mattermark’s continued growth. Specific financial metrics that would be necessary for private equity groups provide less value to sales professionals. The metrics they desire to compare are easier to obtain. Being able to create effective filters for salespeople to identify companies in specific markets to contact is a feature that companies will pay for because it informed pitches, which makes for a very valuable tool. 

Investors require precise information, operate with minimal budgets, and are unforgiving with mistakes. Sales organizations treat company analysis as a funnel, and thus occasional mistakes or inaccuracies are expected. The best market fit for Mattermark is sales intelligence.
