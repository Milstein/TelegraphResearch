Mattermark is a business intelligence tool in the SaaS industry.


## Size

The Software as a Service (SaaS) industry is valued at [over $15 billion](http://www.information-age.com/technology/cloud-and-virtualisation/2095578/saas-will-be-$145bn-market-this-year---gartner) per year. The main factor driving growth is that software is being used to address inefficiencies in other markets. The market for business intelligence SaaS products is rapidly growing.



## Strengths

Mattermark provides insight into companies using quantifiable metrics. This data enables customers to make informed decisions. The filtering features of Mattermark also allow customers to identify companies that meet certain parameters and would be otherwise difficult to identify. The company provides tools that already exist to analyze publicly-traded companies and extends that coverage to private companies.

## Weaknesses

The metrics that Mattermark provides do not directly measure any financial metrics about companies. The proprietary “Mattermark Score” has unknown reliability and utility. The systems mainly tracks technology companies and its metrics favor consumer facing companies.

## Opportunities

Mattermark has the opportunity to provide intelligence data to sales professionals. This market is large, proven, and lucrative. Mattermark already provides a Salesforce integration, but focusing their product on the needs of salespeople could prove to be more valuable. 

## Threats

Mattermark has no proprietary data and its scoring algorithm is currently of little value, thus making it is possible for many competitors to enter the space. Three main threats exist. The first is if an existing financial company that covers public markets expands into covering private markets. This company would have a much stronger reputation and could acquire customers more easily. The second threat that exists is that a competitor could obtain better data than Mattermark. Third, is the threat of a competitor developing a better algorithm that correctly predicts private equity financial trends. 

## Key Factors

Mattermark participates in the market of quantifying private technology companies. The benefit here is not the direct financial analysis of particular companies, but the ability to filter through companies, find competitors, and use alternative data metrics to gain insight once similarities have been identified.

Mattermark is targeted towards private equity investors as a search and analysis tool, but it is also being marketed as a business intelligence tool for salespeople. This sales intelligence strategy may be the key to Mattermark’s continued growth. Specific financial metrics that would be necessary for private equity groups provide less value to sales professionals. The metrics they desire to compare are easier to obtain. Being able to create effective filters for salespeople to identify companies in specific markets to contact is a feature that companies will pay for because it creates informed pitches. 

Investors require precise information, operate with minimal budgets, and are unforgiving with mistakes. Sales organizations treat company analysis as a funnel, and thus occasional mistakes or inaccuracies are expected. The best market fit for Mattermark is sales intelligence.
