## Klout 

Although Klout makes a product targeted at consumers, it draws many parallels to Mattermark’s product and can serve as a good comparison. Klout tries to calculate the amount of “influence” that a particular person voices on the Internet by measuring data from all of one’s social media channels. At the core of Klout’s product is the Klout Score, which is a normalized value used to rank individuals and even companies. Although the algorithm is fairly accurate, it came under criticism for some blatant oversights, such as [giving Justin Biener a higher rating than Barack Obama](http://mashable.com/2012/04/20/klout-time-magazine-100/). In March 2014, [Klout was acquired for $200 million](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2014/03/26/klout-acquired-for-200-million-by-lithium-technologies/) by Lithium Technologies. Mattermark’s product is extremely similar in terms of quantitative analysis, but is aimed more towards investment and businesses. Looking at Mattermark from this point of view shows there could be a lot of potential in this market.

## TechCrunch

In September 2010, AOL acquired TechCrunch for an undisclosed amount, somewhere [between $25 and $40 million](http://www.businessinsider.com/aol-techcrunch-price-25-million-2010-9). This deal included TechCrunch’s CrunchBase product, though its value is marginal compared to the value of TechCrunch’s technology news website, which is what AOL was mostly targeting.
