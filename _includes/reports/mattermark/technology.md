The Mattermark interface appears to use PHP in combination with BackboneJS. It is likely that Mattermark aggregates data from feeds such as news RSS, Alexa, and company websites, then stores it in a SQL database. The type of data they display does not appear consistent with the types of analysis that would require a distributed database that is optimized for data analysis.
