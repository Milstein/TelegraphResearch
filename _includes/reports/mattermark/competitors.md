## DataFox

Founded in [February 2013](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datafox) and with a slight headstart over Mattermark, [DataFox](http://www.datafox.co/) offers almost the exact same proudct as Mattermark, but also attempts to cover publicly traded companies and serve as a much broader tool. The company has raised over $1.5 million in seed funding, with a $1.5 million round closed in October 2013 and an additional round of an undisclosed amount in February 2014. The company was founded by Bastiaan Janmaat, Mike Dorsey, Alden Timme, and Ben Trombley, all from Stanford University. Alden and Ben have solid technical backgrounds in mathematical computing while Bastiaan and Mike have backgrounds in business and operations. The company currently has 9 listed employees on LinkedIn.

Testing out DataFox and comparing it to Mattermark yielded some good insight into both Mattermark’s maturity and this emerging market. Although it has many inaccuracies, the Mattermark Score is generally more much more revealing than DataFox’s equivalent. DataFox offers a much more complete package for all types of businesses in many sectors, but the data seemed very inconsistent. Mattermark drives a much stronger focus towards technology companies with high growth potential, while DataFox seems more focused as a broader quantitative assessment. Mattermark also provides more time-series data and Salesforce integration, but comes at a higher price. DataFox’s equivalent to Mattermark’s limited package is $49/month, while their regular license is $399/month. No price was listed for the team package.


## Inkwire
[Inkwire](http://launch.inkwire.io/) appears to currently be building a product similar to Mattermark and DataFox, but very little information can be found. The comapny attracted some [news](http://gigaom.com/2011/06/10/is-it-time-to-start-factoring-data-into-cost-of-app-ownership/) [articles](http://appadvice.com/appnn/2011/06/quickadvice-inkwire) back in 2011 for an iOS application that curated news content, but it is no longer listed in the App Store. In May 2013, Inkwire was [referencedin a Joyent blog post](http://www.joyent.com/blog/inkwire-looks-to-joyent-for-performance-and-speed) as a company that offers hard to track data to professionals, but almost a year later and the website is still a signup page.  It is unclear if the project is still in full production, but a LinkedIn search shows that Inkwire currently has 7 employees. The company’s [Crunchbase](http://appadvice.com/appnn/2011/06/quickadvice-inkwire) refers to the product as a, “fast, comprehensive ‘instant analysis’ secret used by top VCs to find investment winners, losers, and hidden gems.” It goes on to say that Inkwire, “converts unstructured big data from public and hidden Web into actionable insight for banks, investment firms, and private investors … [and] allows investors to objectively and accurately measure momentum across key metrics.”

## Indicate

Much like Inkwire, [Indicate](http://indicate.io/) by Disruption Corporation is another unlaunched company that will soon be entering the space with an analysis tool aimed towards assiting venture capitalists. No news articles could be found, however it is reported that they received $750k in seed funding in March 2013 on [Crunchbase](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/disruption-corp).


## Crunchbase by TechCrunch

[Crunchbase](http://www.crunchbase.com/) is a website operated by [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/) that is one of the most frequently used tools for gathering information on a tech company. Companies are listed in a unique profile, with each providing key facts about the company including: funding rounds, important milestones, leadership team, and recent news articles. The website is free to use, but does not offer much in terms of analysis, time-series data, or predictions.
