## DataFox

Founded [four months prior](http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datafox) to the launch of Mattermark, [DataFox](http://www.datafox.co/) offers a competing intelligence platform with broader scope. The company has raised a $1.5 million round closed in October 2013 and an additional round of an undisclosed sum in February 2014. The company was founded by a group of Stanford University alumni: Bastiaan Janmaat, Mike Dorsey, Alden Timme, and Ben Trombley. Alden and Ben have strong technical backgrounds in mathematical computing, and Bastiaan and Mike have backgrounds in both business and operations. The company currently has 9 listed employees on LinkedIn.

Testing DataFox and comparing it to Mattermark showed Mattermark to be a more mature product. Although imprecise, the Mattermark Score seems more accurate the  DataFox equivalent. However, DataFox offers insights on about twice as many companies. Mattermark provides more time-series data and a Salesforce integration, but costs more. DataFox offers two packages at $49 per month for personal plans, and $399 per month for professional plans. No price was listed for the enterprise package.
