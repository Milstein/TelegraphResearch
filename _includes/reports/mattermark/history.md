## How it Works
Mattermark provides a platform that allows a customer to quantitatively assess the performance of thousands of private companies with high growth potential. The tool visualizes a variety of current and historical data including website traffic, Twitter mentions, Facebook likes, number of employees, and recent press coverage. Other types of data include recent funding, related news articles, competitors, and members of the management team. Mattermark analyzes the data it collects to generate a proprietary “Mattermark Score” that aims to track the company health and growth potential. Mattermark also offers features that enable a customer to compare similar companies against each other, and the product supports Salesforce Integration. One seat of Mattermark software costs for $499 per month, but a new restricted seat is available for $99 per month. Team packages start at $1,999 per month.
