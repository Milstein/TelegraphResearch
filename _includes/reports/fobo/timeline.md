FOBO started in 2011 under the name Yardsale. The founders entered the Summer 2011 class of Y Combinator. Their original product was an application that made it easier to sell goods on Craigslist. They went on to raise seed funding of [$1.6 Million](https://angel.co/FOBO) by October 2013. Notable contributors include [Tim Ferriss](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Ferriss), Digg co-founder [Kevin Rose](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose), and Greylock Partners. Approximately one year ago, the team appears to have suspended active development of Yardsale to begin building FOBO under the same legal entity.
