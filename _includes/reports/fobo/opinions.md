There are some aspects to FOBO that I really like. It takes minimal effort, is very fast to complete a transaction, and items are guaranteed to sell. [Blog posts](http://benguild.com/2014/02/10/the-weekend-that-i-tried-to-sell-three-plasma-tvs/) and reviews indicate that the marketplace is really starting to take off in San Francisco, but I am cautious in thinking they will be able to repeat the same level of success ([10% week over week growth](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7478842)) in other markets. FOBO charges a very high premium compared to their competitors, and I’m wondering if that will be a turnoff for participants in other regions of the country

Compared to other marketplace companies, FOBO will also expect higher human related costs. Every item that doesn’t sell in their auction has to purchased, picked up, stored, sold, and shipped. Even with many participants, it seems very possible that a fair amount of items will not be sold and require FOBO to handle; more capital will be needed to maintain a dedicated workforce in all markets.

I am also wary of possible exit strategies. After reviewing similar marketplace companies, I found there to be very few exits. Aside from the eBay IPO, there haven’t been any IPOs and all acquisitions have been by eBay for various foreign marketplaces. Other marketplaces for electronics such as Glyde and Gazelle are over eight years old and still seem distant from any type of exit. Amazon did not add any type of people to people marketplace until 2000, well after their IPO. Given FOBO’s rapid growth in San Francisco, I think that a Series A is definitely justifiable to help the company expand and try out a few other markets.

Selling electronics is a pain. While many marketplaces exist, each has their own form of friction that acts as a barrier to easy selling. Whether it is an online auction where you have to ship an item, classifieds where items are commonly misrepresented, or smaller groups where selling the item requires cash. FOBO capitalizes on the high price of electronic goods to make an easy-to-use market for selling luxury goods. 

To sell an item on FOBO, you forfeit 15% of the item’s sale price. When I sold my laptop through their marketplace, this turned out to be a significant amount of money. However, every other step of the process is superior to existing secondhand markets. Listing the item was straightforward - I used actual photos, I was presented with a selling price, and I did not have to write a long marketing description. 

Buying is equally smooth on FOBO. Buyers can set up alerts for items they want. They know that sellers are near them. The exchange of money happens in the background so that no last-minute haggling can take place. Sellers have a rating. 

Every month a new “craigslist killer” enters the market, but few will gain any traction. The two factors that will help FOBO to succeed against Craigslist are its focus on luxury items and its sale fee. When buyers purchase luxury items, they desire a reliable selling process and thus are less risk-averse. In order to provide this experience, FOBO’s 15% fee, though high, provides them with the revenue to continue building the product. By having strong monetization built in early, traction fuels growth. 

With bad interfaces, unreliable selling processes, and difficult fulfillment, the used good market has been ripe for change - but quite resistant to it. FOBO’s strategy of catering to tech-savvy buyers of electronic goods has given them a strong niche. To grow from a niche business to an accessible selling tool, they must continue to expand geographically while expanding the products users may sell on their application.
