##eBay

[eBay](http://www.ebay.com/) first began as AuctionWeb in September of 1995 as a personal project by Pierre Omidyar. The site offered timed auctions on any user-listed item, with anyone able to bid to purchase a listed item. The site quickly took off and saw immense growth, recording over [2 million auctions in 1997](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay#History). The company went public in September 1998 and continued to grow throughout the following ten years. In 2013, the company saw yearly [revenues of $16 billion](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140122006447/en/eBay-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-Full-Year-2013#.UzrZ_a1dU4A). eBay still offers its traditional consumer to consumer auctions, but also offers a large variety of other services such as online money transfers through PayPal and event ticket trading through Stubhub.

eBay is a massive corporation and remains the go to source for someone to sell any item online while FOBO is a new startup that only offers a marketplace for electronics. Unlike FOBO, sales on eBay are not limited to any geographic region, nor does eBay demand such a high commission fee. On the contrary, eBay does not offer any guarantee that the item will sell, auctions run much longer, and sellers must go through the hassle of shipping the items.

##Craigslist

[Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.org/about/sites) is an online classifieds marketplace that was founded in 1995 by Craig Newmark. The site allows anyone to post a classified listing to a specific forum in their geographic region. The main categories are community, housing, jobs, personals, for sale, discussion forums, services, gigs, and resumes; within for sale are nearly 40 different listings such as appliances, electronics, cell phones, and tickets. The site offers local classified listings across the world and reported having [over 700 marketplaces in over 70 countries](https://www.craigslist.org/about/factsheet). Most of the service is free, though there are specific forums that ask for listing fees. The company remains privately held and an exit does not seem to be in the plans anytime soon.

Like FOBO, Craigslist offers a local marketplace for exchanging goods, but without the fees. On the flipside, Craigslist has become known in popular culture for being a shady service, as there is zero transparency as to who buyers and sellers really are. 

##Amazon Marketplace

[Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/) was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos as an online bookstore. The company saw immediate success and went public in 1997. As the company grew, Amazon began adding many different products within e-commerce, and launched the Amazon Marketplace in 2000. Amazon Marketplace enables anyone to sell new and [used goods alongside the regular listings by Amazon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Marketplace). Although the service is mostly used by other businesses, anyone can create a seller account and post their used items online. Important to note for Amazon is the level of quality that is demanded for sellers. Items being sold on the site must be in good condition and match the description of the listing. Sellers who fail to meet this standard will be removed from the service. From a buying perspective, items sold in the Amazon marketplace have a higher quality assurance as opposed to eBay and Craigslist, where such standards are not held.
