FOBO competes in the online classifieds industry and specializes in used electronics. Being just over two months since launching, the service is currently geographically exclusive to San Francisco. Their local, ultra-quick auctions with a guarantee for items to sell have caught on quickly and the company has already passed a $1 million run rate.

## Size

The entire online classifieds marketplace industry is valued at [over $20 billion a year](http://www.wired.com/2009/08/craigslist-vs-ebay/). This figure includes all types of products such as vehicles, electronics, furniture, and many other categories. 

## Major Participants

Used electronics can be exchanged via many different marketplaces, the largest two being eBay and Craigslist. Items purchased on eBay are paid for online and shipped, but items sold on Craigslist, like FOBO, are purchased locally and require an in-person exchange. There are many other ways that people choose to sell used electronics. Some establish an Amazon seller account, others prefer buyback programs such as those offered by companies like Newegg or Radioshack, while some prefer to sell to their friends and list the items for sale within specific groups on Facebook. The number of used goods exchanges is profuse, and some other exchanges discovered in Google Search include Glyde, Gazelle, Listia, and Yardsellr.


## History and Trends

The closest competitor to FOBO is Craigslist. For local selling of items, Craigslist is the most popular service. To understand the history and trends in the online selling market, we analyze Craiglist. 

### Strengths
Craigslist ranks as the tenth most popular website in the United States ([Alexa](http://alexa.com)), making it is the most popular marketplace for selling goods and services locally. Thus, its most important strength is its brand recognition and ubiquity - the website has a thriving market of sellers and it has a thriving market of buyers. In addition, Craigslist provides listings in a broad range of categories ranging from electronics to apartments to jobs. The interface for listing an item for sale is relatively simple and does not require creating an account. 

### Weaknesses

While Craigslist accumulates items across a wide variety of fields, the process of searching for and acquiring a desired item is difficult. For example, while there is a search engine, there is not way to set up alerts about a particular type of item. 

Upon finding the listings for an item you desire, it is often difficult to gauge the state of the item. For instance, sellers often use an example image instead of the actual image of a product. 

In order to acquire an item, a use emails the seller expressing interest. The seller may not always respond in a timely manner, and often listings are not deleted after a sale has been agreed upon. 

When users meet to handle the purchase of the item, often the transaction must be in cash. This presents liability issues. In addition, often users may attempt to re-negotiate the sale price of an item. 

### Opportunities

Craigslist can enter any new market with ease, thus allowing it to basically sell anything anywhere. In addition, they are free to experiment with monetization. For instance, in some markets Craigslist charges for job listings. 

The selling experience, though simple, has the opportunity to be improved. For instance, an official mobile application that allows the capture and upload of images with a listing would increase transparency.

Finally, currently Craiglist does not currently collect feedback about sellers after the transaction. Creating a buyer reputation system could make it easier to sell on the website. 

### Threats

The main threat against Craigslist is that they are entrenched in so many geographic and product markets that the company is unlikely to respond to smaller threats. This means that there is the opportunity for companies to begin eroding the Craiglist market share by targeting a specific vertical in a specific market. 

In addition, Craiglist does not allow bidding. This means that inefficiency in selling exists - specifically, that buyers are responsible for determining the price for their item when buyers may be willing to pay more.



## Key Factors
Generally, successful marketplaces offer a high level of efficiency, but different marketplaces have become efficient through different fundamental principles. For example, eBay gives sellers access to an enormous population of interested buyers and allows prices to freely fluctuate with demand. Craigslist encourages sellers to post by eliminating listing fees and limits the marketplace to nearby geographic regions. This can facilitate much quicker transactions if needed by a buyer, but prices aren’t always as transparent as eBay. eBay’s audience and time-sensitive auction format make items more likely to sell, but like Craigslist, there is still no guarantee. A seller nervous of an in-person exchange with a stranger may choose to sell through Facebook to their friend group, but loses the large audiences of other marketplaces.

FOBO’s marketplace offers advantages seen in many of the successful predecessors. Auctions are quick, prices can freely fluctuate with demand, and there is a guarantee that each item will be sold at a fair and transparent value. As a tradeoff, FOBO carries an above average listing fee.
