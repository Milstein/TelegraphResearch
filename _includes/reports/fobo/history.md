## History
[FOBO](http://www.fobo.net/) is a local marketplace for selling used consumer electronics that [launched on January 10, 2014](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/10/fobo/). The mobile application aims to eliminate the hassle of selling and offers quick and simple auctions. The founders, Ed McManus and Ryan Mickle, had previously developed a similar venture, Yardsale, as part of the Y Combinator Summer 2011 class and pivoted towards FOBO sometime in 2013. FOBO received [Seed funding of $1.6 million](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/fobo) in October of 2013 and the round included Greylock Partners, Index Ventures, Tim Ferriss, and Kevin Rose, among others. On March 16, 2014 it was reported that FOBO had already hit a [million dollar run rate](http://techcrunch.com/2014/03/16/fobo-video/).

## How it Works
FOBO provides local, on-demand auctions. Three important processes happen: Selling, buying, and fulfillment. 

To sell an item, a user downloads the FOBO app, then selects the item from a list of eligible technology items. If the item is common, for example an Apple product, details on the configuration and current state of the item are collected. In most cases where the item is of a major make or model, the FOBO system prices the minimum price automatically. In some cases, an item such as a specific model of speaker may not already be in the FOBO database. In that case, information about the item and the item quality are collected, then a FOBO representative manually sets a minimum selling price that a seller may then accept or decline. 

The seller uses the app to take photos of the item, then the auction is published. The seller is guaranteed at least the minimum selling price stated in the application, and most auctions start at that minimum amount. Auctions last 97 minutes, and the odd length of the auction appears to be an attempt at quirkiness for the brand. Recently, auctions have been delayed after listing until a time when more sellers are available. 

Sellers participate in auctions through the FOBO iPhone app, which shows all local auctions that are upcoming, in progress, or recently completed. Sellers may set push notifications for auctions of interested. For example, a user could “watch” for auctions of Macbooks. Sellers enter credit card information to pay for an item they may win. The app also requires bidders to comment about why they are purchasing the item. This makes the system social. 

After 97 minutes, both the seller and the highest-bidding purchaser are notified. The phone numbers of the two are exchanged, and pickup of the item should be arranged in the following 48 hours. 

If nobody bids on the item, FOBO becomes the default “buyer” - they act as seller, arrange pickup, and pay for the item as a normal buyer would. In this sense, FOBO guarantees their minimum selling price by buying the item in the absence of a seller.

Fulfilment is arranged via text message between the seller and buyer. Normally the buyer is responsible for picking up the item. To exchange the item, the buyer inspects the item in person, and when they decide that the item and its condition are as expected, both the buyer and the seller note on the FOBO app that the exchange has completed. At this time, the buyer’s credit card is charged, and the seller is credited instantly with 85% of the item’s selling price. 15% of the price is reserved by FOBO as a fee for completing the transaction. The seller may use credit from the sale to make FOBO purchases, or they may “cash out” at any time, where their account balance is deposited to their bank account. 

After the exchange is confirmed, the sale is considered “finalized.” In the case of a chargeback, where the buyer’s credit card forcibly withdraws payment to FOBO, the seller could be held responsible for returning funds to FOBO.
