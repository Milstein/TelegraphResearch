<tr><td>Philip</td><td>
How does a company begin using Hired?
</td>
</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>They submit an online application and have an onboarding call with one of our account managers. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Ok, so there is no subscription fee, right?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>No subscription fee, no. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>And what type of size and stage of company make up most of your active users? 

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>Mostly series A and series B companies, but we have a lot of later-stage companies as well. We work with everybody from Square and Facebook to Staples, Amex, Capital One.

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Is there a threshold for starting to use Hired that you use a metric? 

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>Well, we only deal with venture-funded or publicly-traded companies. We don’t talk to bootstrapped businesses. The seed-stage companies are generally better off recruiting through their network, based on our extensive data analysis. It’s only the later-stage companies that, you know,  really you can hit the hiring title hard that get the most out of the marketplace. A lot of guys just pick the seed-stage companies or are dealing with first-time founders and CEOs, looking for some other specific cofounder - basically looking for a life-partner, not an employee - and they’re five or six people in. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td> In terms of the offers that candidates receive - are those always reflective of the final salary? Are those binding?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>90% of the time, they are. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>90% of the time? Ok. And, where are your candidates from, geographically?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>About 70% are in San Francisco, 20% are in New York, and 10% are from around other parts of the US, like Seattle, Chicago, Austin. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Ok, so not many relocations. It’s mostly local candidates?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>That’s right. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Ok. And, in terms of Hired as a recruiting tool, is your goal to make it the primary recruiting tool for most of your companies, or is this going to be something that is more geared more towards the candidates?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>We’re going to become a career marketplace for workers in the world, ranging from new grad <em>[Audio cut-out]</em>. We’re very candidate-focused whenever we have to make a decision or take side of the [unintelligible]. Our goal is to empower them and allow them to conduct their own job search in a really trendy and comprehensive way, as opposed to submitting resumes and hoping for a reply. Or using agency recruiters who don’t have your best interest in heart. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Yeah. So then, is the bottleneck for growth right now getting more candidates on the website, or getting more employers to use it? 

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>They’ve been growing in line very steadily. So, when we look at the graphs for Q4 the numbers <em>[Audio cut-out]</em> are trending almost perfectly in line with number of candidates. So, for us, it’s more a matter of scaling geographically and to different markets. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Which metrics are you using are you using to decide to open in a new city? Are you opening to more markets, then?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>Yes, we will be opening additional offices this year. We opened our New York office in December. It’s already profitable. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Oh, great. How has the retention of recruiters, company-side, been?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>It’s been tremendous. We have hundreds of active employers every single month. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Ok. And, your website shows how many candidates receive an offer. But, do you have information on how many go through with accepting offers?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>We don’t disclose that information. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Ok. And, can you talk about the phishing emails that some recruiters were sent last month?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>Sorry, what was the question?

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>I spoke with some recruiters who were using Hired, and they reported that there had been some phishing emails that ended up being sent, or seemed to be sent, from Hired. Do you know - was there a data breach of some kind? 

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>Ah, yes. So one of our employees had their GMail account hacked. So, some phishing emails were sent from her personal email address to our employers. But it wasn’t a data breach. No one gained database access to the application or the marketplace itself. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Ok, great. Thank you. Was there anything else that you wanted to mention? I think this basically wraps up my questions. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>I’m not sure what you have this because I haven’t seen your research, but we also just had our first international auction in partnership with Sequoia Capital. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>Great. I noticed in an Australian newspaper that there was discussion about international recruiting. Are you working for those international auctions for bringing international candidates to existing US markets?

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>That’s right. We ran a global casting call over the last four to six weeks in partner with Sequoia to get their companies on board with sponsoring H-1B visas. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Philip</td><td>I think that answers all of my questions. Thanks a lot for your time, Matt. 

</td></tr><tr><td>Matt</td><td>Ok, thanks. Bye.
